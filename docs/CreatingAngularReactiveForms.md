# Creating Angular Reactive Forms

## Adding Reactive Forms to a Project

[commit 1998d61](https://github.com/marcoandre1/contacts-app/commit/1998d615c5b0e4172a2bd5b426a05d8389d2be82)

Keep in mind that we add `ReactiveFormsModule` in `app.module.ts`, however this is not mandatory. By doing so, we are enabling Reactive Forms throughout our application. Ideally, Reactive Forms should be imported only in the needed component.
